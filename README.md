**Activate Virtual Environment**
I have added all the libraries to requirements.txt

To start your environment follow these steps
`python3 -m env myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

**Changing Installed Libraries**
If you download another library with pip install you must run
`pip freeze > requirements.txt` and push the new requirements to github
